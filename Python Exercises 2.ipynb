    "Below is a list of numbers.  In the list they are out of order.  You need to write a Python code that prints the smallest number.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, one could use a loop. You could check each element of the list and keep track of the smallest.  However, thanks to list methods, we can write a code that does not need loops.  Python lists have [several methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp).  One methods is called `sort()` which simply sorts the list according to the convention of the data types in the list (e.g. it will sort integers and floats ordinally).  Once you sort the list, you can use list indexing to get the first item of a list and print it."
